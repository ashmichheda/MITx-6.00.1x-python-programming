Problem 1

Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained 
in the string s. 
Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
Number of vowels: 5
"""

s = 'aeiouash'
countVowel = 0
for temp in s:
    if temp == 'a' or temp == 'e' or temp == 'i' or temp == 'o' or temp == 'u':
        countVowel += 1
print('Number of vowels: '+ str(countVowel))
